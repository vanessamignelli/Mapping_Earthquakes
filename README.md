# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Objective 
The purpose of this assignment was to map earthquakes using javascript, api's and leaflet. There are 3 overlay maps, with one showing visualizations related to tectonic plates, one showing visualizations related to all earthquakes and the final one showing visualizations related to major earthquakes. These layers can be toggled on and off and the user's discretion. Additionally, the map can be viewed in 3 different ways - from the light street view, the satellite street view as well as the dark map option.
